# CRU Data Summaries

These data summaries draw upon the [original CRU data](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Climate_Data/CRU/CRU_v4_04) to create monthly and annual climatic summaries for 1950-2019. They were produced using [this script](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Climate_Data/CRU/scripts/monthly_annual_CRUsummaries.R). 



**NOTE: THERE IS CURRENTLY AN ERROR FOR VARIABLES WHOSE MONTHLY VALUES ARE SUMMED TO PRODUCE AN ANNUAL VALUE (E.G., PRECIPITATION)! SEE [ISSUE #39](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/issues/39).**
