RELEASE NOTES FOR CRU TS v3.25 / v4.01 OBSERVATIONS: September 2017

The 3.25 and 4.01 releases of the CRU TS dataset cover the period
1901-2016.
They supercede all earlier releases. The reference to use is:

Harris, I., Jones, P.D., Osborn, T.J. and Lister, D.H. (2014), Updated
high-resolution grids of monthly climatic observations – the CRU TS3.10
Dataset. Int. J. Climatol., 34: 623–642. doi: 10.1002/joc.3711

Please read the Release Notes for v4.01 for additional information.

The 'observations' directory contains the station observations used to
build this release of the CRU TS dataset; they have been corrected as
necessary. As various improvements have been made to individual
variables, particularly TMP, TMN and TMX, a variety of time stamps are
seen.

Only the four main databases are presented, and they have been
'cleaned' - in that observations not used in production of the dataset
have been eliminated. This is usually due to the station having
insufficient support between 1961 and 1990 (the period used to construct
station anomalies).

The four databases are:

pre.1704241136.clean.dtb
tmp.1708041519.clean.dtb
tmn.1708171135.clean.dtb
tmx.1708171215.clean.dtb

Please refer to the published paper (above) to understand how they
contribute to the dataset. The version release notes give more
information about changes to the observational holdings.

As always, please contact BADC in the first instance if you have any
questions, obervations or suggestions.
