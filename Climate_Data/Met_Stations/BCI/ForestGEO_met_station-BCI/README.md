# ForestGEO Weather Station @ Barro Colorado Island (BCI)

**Temporal coverage**: 03/10/2011 - present 

**Temporal resolution**: 5 min

**Location**: tower above canopy near ForestGEO plot (eddy flux tower)

**Variables**: Solar (shortwave) radiation, Precipitation, Wind speed & direction (2D), Air Temperature, Relative humidity 

## Data set description:
In 2009 ForestGEO started its own meteorological program. Four standardized stations were built in collaboration with Bill Munger (Harvard University) and installed near four ForestGEO plots: SCBI, KHC, HKK and BCI. The ForestGEO stations comprise several sensors recorded automatically by a CR1000 datalogger (Campbell Scientific) at 5 min time interval. These sensors include:
1)	Aspirated and shield temperature and relative humidity sensor plus an additional secondary temperature sensor (MetOne Instruments)
2)	 2-D sonic anemometer WS425 (Vaisala)
3)	Tipping rain bucket TB4-L (Campbell Scientific)
4)	Solar radiometer CMP11 (Kipp&Zonen), plus a secondary radiometer LI-290 (LiCOR biogeoscience)
