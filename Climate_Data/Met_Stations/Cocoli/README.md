# Meteorological Station Data for Cocoli 

## Overview of available data products
Cocoli has no on-site meteorological monitoring.

A nearby meteorological station is the [**Parque Natural Metropolitano canopy crane**](http://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/physical_monitoring/research/metpark) (established in 1995) at the northwestern edge of Panama City. All data are archived and freely available through the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's physical monitoring program](http://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/physical_monitoring/). Steve Paton (Director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Insitute's Physical Monitoring program) has developed a method to gap fill these records using data averaged from two nearby Panama Canal Authority stations – Albrook Airbase and Balboa Heights, located 4-5 km away. A record that has been gap-filled and interpolated back to 1981 using this method is archived [here](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Climate_Data/Met_Stations/Cocoli/GapFilled%26Interpolated).
