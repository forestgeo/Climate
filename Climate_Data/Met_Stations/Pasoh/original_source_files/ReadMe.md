# original Pasoh weather data files

These weather data were collected by [TEAM](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Climate_Data/Met_Stations/Pasoh/original_source_files/TEAM) and [ForestGEO](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Climate_Data/Met_Stations/Pasoh/original_source_files/ForestGEO%20station).

The majority of these files were sent to K. Anderson-Teixeira by Yao Tze Leong in 2018. There is also [one file](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Met_Station_Data/Pasoh/original_source_files/ForestGEO%20station/2018/CR1000_CLData.dat) downloaded from the ForestGEO weather station by Nobby Kunert in Dec. 2018. 

## Known issues:
- large time gaps 
- unreliable air humidity data that are almost always greater than 100%
