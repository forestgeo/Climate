TEAM DataPackage
  
  A DataPackage is a zip file that contains all of the datasets selected to download in the
  Data Query and Download section of www.teamnetwork.org.  The TEAM DataPackage also contains important
  metadata documents that will help you to understand and use TEAM Protocol data.  When a TEAM DataPackage
  is unzipped directories will be created for each Protocol for which you have selected to download data. For example,
  if only Avian Protocol data was selected an "Avian" directory is created.  In this directory will be all the data files
  and the metadata file associated with the Avian dataset.

Important Information:

The TEAM Network Database is constantly being updated with new data as it comes in from TEAM Sites.  Data are also
constantly undergoing QA/QC (Quality Assurance and Quality Control) measures to ensure 
TEAM Network Data are of the highest scientific value.  Therefore it is important to check back frequently to ensure you
have the latest TEAM Data.  A "Dataset ID" is included in each TEAM Protocol dataset to easily track which version of data 
you have downloaded.  Please refer to the Data Use Policy printed in the first 62 lines of each dataset for questions
on the use or acknowledgement of TEAM Data.
