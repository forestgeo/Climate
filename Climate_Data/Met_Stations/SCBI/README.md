# Meteorological Station Data for Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI)

## Overview of available data products
SCBI currently has extensive meteorological monitoring, including:

1- **ForestGEO meteorological station**, starting 2009. All data are archived [here](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Met_Station_Data/SCBI/ForestGEO_met_station-SCBI).

2- **National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) terrestrial and aquatic monitoring stations**, starting 2015. Monitoring stations include an above-canopy tower just outside the ForestGEO plot, with measurements at a variety of heights above/within/below the canopy (terrestrial site - "SCBI"), and below-canopy stations along a stream within the plot (aquatic site - "POSE"). All data are archived and freely available on [NEON's data portal](http://data.neonscience.org/home). 

For studies requiring data prior to 2009, we recommend:

3- **Front Royal weather station**. This is a nearby off-site weather station, with records going back to 1995. Data are available through [NOAA](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/findstation), with some records archived [here](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Met_Station_Data/SCBI/Front%20Royal%20weather%20station) for convenience.

...and the following gridded data products:

4- [**PRISM climate data**](http://prism.oregonstate.edu/). We have purchased monthly data for 1930-2015 at 800m spatial resolution, which are available upon request from Kristina Anderson-Teixeira. 

5- [**NOAA Divisional Data**](https://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/CDODivisionalSelect.jsp#). NOAA data for N. Virginia, downloaded in December 2017 are posted [here](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Gridded_Data_Products/NOAA%20Divisional%20Data%20(USA)/Virginia_04_Northern_Virginia). Variables include Palmer Drought Severity Index.
