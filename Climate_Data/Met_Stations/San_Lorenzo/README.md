# Meteorological Station Data for San Lorenzo (Fort Sherman) 

## Overview of available data products
San Lorenzo has an on-site meteorological station: [**San Lorenzo canopy crane**](http://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/physical_monitoring/research/sherman), established in 1981. All data are archived and freely available through the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's physical monitoring program](http://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/physical_monitoring/). 

Steve Paton (Director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Insitute's Physical Monitoring program) has developed a method to gap fill these records using data from two nearby Panama Canal Authority stations. A cleaned and gap-filled record applying this method is archived [here](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Met_Station_Data/San_Lorenzo/GapFilled%26Interpolated).

[NGEE-Tropics meteorological drivers data](https://ngt-data.lbl.gov/dois/NGT0055/) includes half-hour data for multiple variables starting in 2008.
