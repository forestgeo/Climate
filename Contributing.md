# Contributing to the CTFS-ForestGEO Climate Data Portal: 

We anticipate that the CTFS-ForestGEO Climate Data Portal will be of great value for various researchers seeking to understand the influence of climate on forests worldwide. We encourage CTFS-ForestGEO to increase its value by contributing information and data of value to the research community. This portal is set up in Github so that anyone in the CTFS-ForestGEO research network can update exisiting files or contribute data. Basic instructions for using Github can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## Basic instructions for contributing to the CTFS-ForestGEO Climate Data Portal: 
1.	If you wish to modify an existing file, download the latest version of the file. Microsoft Word files used to create PDFs are included in the repository so that they can be modified. If you'll be submitting new files, existing files may be downloaded as templates, if desireable.
2.	Create a new **branch**, including your username in the branch name.  
3.	Create or modify files, ensuring that: 
    a.	You have checked to ensure that the data are accurate and that missing values are filled with an appropriate code (e.g., NA).
    b.  Any new data files are properly documented with a metadata file, including a list of column headers, their definitions, and their units.  
    c.	Any updated files conform to existing metadata descriptions (or you modify the descriptions appropriately)  
    d.	State any conditions of data use in the metadata file.
    e.  Please provide the name of the most appropriate person/people who may be contacted with questions/ requests for collaboration. 
    f.	All data are ready to be made public.   
4.	Open a pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/. This will compare changes across the master branch and the new branch.  
5.	Database authors will approve pull request and merge changes. Delete branch when changes have been merged.  

## Basic instructions for creating an "issue":
If you would like to open a discussion on the data or database, suggest changes that you do not feel comfortable making yourself, or report a problem, you may do so by submitting a [Github issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). Note that issues are visible to all database users/ the public.
