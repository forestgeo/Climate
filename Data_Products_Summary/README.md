# CTFS-ForestGEO Climate Data Products Summary

## Overview

This folder contains files summarizing the climate data sources for ForestGEO sites. It may be used as a guide for the CTFS-ForestGEO research community to identify available climate data products. It will also serve as a portal for site PIs and data set originators to inform others about the availability of relevant data products.

This information was originally compiled by Kristina Anderson-Teixeira and members of the CTFS-ForestGEO Ecosystems & Climate Lab at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (especially Erika Gonzalez-Akre) based upon the information that we had on hand. It is not a complete listing of available data products, and many records for local weather stations remain incomplete. Researchers should contact site PIs for the most complete and accurate information on local weather stations.

## Files
[`ForestGEO climate data sources.csv`](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Data_Products_Summary/ForestGEO%20climate%20data%20sources.csv) - File listing climate data sources available for ForestGEO sites, as described in the metadata file.

[`ForestGEO_gridded climate data.csv`](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Data_Products_Summary/ForestGEO_gridded%20climate%20data.csv) - File indicating the ForestGEO sites for which the global gridded data products listed in `ForestGEO climate data sources.csv` have been extracted. 

[`ForestGEO climate data sources - metadata.pdf`](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Data_Products_Summary/ForestGEO%20climate%20data%20sources%20-%20metadata.pdf) - Metadata file describing the contents of [`ForestGEO climate data sources.csv`](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Data_Products_Summary/ForestGEO%20climate%20data%20sources.csv)  and [`ForestGEO_gridded climate data.csv`](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Data_Products_Summary/ForestGEO_gridded%20climate%20data.csv). An editable [.docx](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Data_Products_Summary/ForestGEO%20climate%20data%20sources%20-%20metadata.docx) file is also available for updating the .pdf.
