# ForestGEO Climate Data Products Summary

## Overview

[**`ForestGEO climate data sources`**](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Directory/ForestGEO%20climate%20data%20sources.csv) summarizes climate data products available for ForestGEO sites and points to the location from which they can be obtained, within this data portal or elsewhere. It may be used as a guide for the ForestGEO research community to help identify available climate data products. It can also serve as a portal for site PIs and data set originators to inform others about the availability of relevant data products.

**This is not a complete listing of available data products, and many records for local weather stations remain incomplete.** Researchers should contact site PIs for the most complete and accurate information on local weather stations. When appropriate weather station data are not available, we encourage researchers to explore the latest available gridded climate data products. We will be grateful for additions and updates to this directory.

*All data in the Portal are public; in order to support proper citation of the data, we identify a combination of data contacts, URLs, and related publications in the [`ForestGEO climate data sources.csv`](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Directory/ForestGEO%20climate%20data%20sources.csv) and [`ForestGEO_gridded climate data.csv`](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Directory/ForestGEO_gridded%20climate%20data.csv) files.*

## User tips
To use this spreadsheet to identify relevant data sources, filter by 'Site' (including "ANY SITE" if interested in gridded data products) and 'Variable' of interest. Data may also be filtered by a variety of other potential constraints-- for example, `Start.Date`, whether the data have been gap filled `Gap.Free?`, or where the instruments are located relative to the ForestGEO plot canopy (`Instrument.Location`).
