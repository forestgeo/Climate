RELEASE NOTES FOR CRU TS v4.04 OBSERVATIONS: April 2020

The 4.04 release of the CRU TS dataset covers the period 1901-2019.
It supercedes all earlier releases. The reference to use is:

Harris, I., Osborn, T.J., Jones, P. et al. Version 4 of the CRU TS
monthly high-resolution gridded multivariate climate dataset.
Sci Data 7, 109 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0453-3

Please read the Release Notes for v4.04 for additional information.

The 'observations' directory contains the station observations used to
build this release of the CRU TS dataset; they have been corrected as
necessary.

Only the four main databases are presented, and they have been
'cleaned' - in that observations not used in production of the dataset
have been eliminated. This is usually due to the station having
insufficient support between 1961 and 1990 (the period used to construct
station anomalies).

The four databases are:

pre.2004011744.clean.dtb
tmn.2004011744.clean.dtb
tmp.2004011744.clean.dtb
tmx.2004011744.clean.dtb

Please refer to the published paper (above) to understand how they
contribute to the dataset. The version release notes give more
information about changes to the observational holdings.

As always, please contact BADC in the first instance if you have any
questions, obervations or suggestions. If, however, you wish to contact
CRU directly about these datasets, please contact me at
i.harris@uea.ac.uk, as mail to other members of the Unit will be passed
through to me anyway.
