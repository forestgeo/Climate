# Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data for ForestGEO Sites

**Temporal coverage**: 1998-01 to 2014-12 

**Temporal resolution**: Monthly, annual

**Geographic coverage**: 50 to -50 degrees latitude

**Spatial resolution**: 0.25° by 0.25°




## Data set description:

The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) by NASA was launched in 1997 and carried 5 instruments: a 3-sensor rainfall suite (PR, TMI, VIRS) and 2 related instruments (LIS and CERES). Specific information on sensors and data generation can be accessed here http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov. For a summary of TRMM data products and services, see Liu et al. (2012).

Data presented here are from the “Algorithm 3B43”, which gives the best-estimate precipitation rate and root-mean-square (RMS) precipitation-error estimates from TRMM.  Algorithm 3B43 is executed once per calendar month to produce the single, best-estimate precipitation rate and RMS precipitation-error estimate field (3B43) by combining the 3-hourly merged high-quality/IR estimates with the monthly accumulated Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) rain gauge analysis.

Monthly precipitation data were downloaded on October 21, 2015 for 63 CTFS-ForestGEO tropical, subtropical, and temperate sites (-50 to 50 degrees latitude). Data was retrieved from the Mirador interface (http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov) from NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). Version 7 was downloaded. Units were converted from mm hr-1 to mm mo-1 by multiplying by the number of hours in each month, and annual precipitation was computed by summing months. 

## Notes:

Comparison of TRMM data to local weather station data for ForestGEO sites (Table 2 in Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2015) showed that TRMM data tended to systematically underestimate MAP at sites with high MAP, particularly those receiving >3000 mm yr-1. Thus, TRMM precipitation values for high precipitation sites should be considered probable underestimates.
