# CTFS-ForestGEO Climate Data Portal  

## About this repository
This public repository is a portal for climate data and information for [CTFS-ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) sites. It has two primary functions:

### 1. Source of information on available climate data- 
We are compiling a database of climate data sources that are available for CTFS-ForestGEO sites. It will soon be available on this site, and until then is available upon request from Kristina Anderson-Teixeira.

In addition, individual sites may have README files describing the best available sources of climate data (for example, [SCBI](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/Met_Station_Data/SCBI/README.md)).

### 2. Climate data repository-
This site archives and distributes two types of data:

[**1. Meteorological Station Data**](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Met_Station_Data)- We host meteorological station data for CTFS-ForestGEO sites that are not readily available through other public repositories. This includes (i) raw data products and (ii) cleaned/ gap-filled datasets (based on raw data products that may be archived elsewhere). 

[**2. Gridded data products**](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Gridded_Data_Products)- For convenience, we re-distribute data extracted from open-access gridded databases for CTFS-ForestGEO sites. 


## Contributing to this repository
We strongly encourage researchers in the CTFS-ForestGEO community to contribute relevant information and data to this repository:

* Updates regarding available climate data are of great value to the research community and will facilitate collaborations. 

* Site managers/ meteorological data owners may use this portal as a stable repository to archive and distribute their data (if data are not already hosted elsewhere).

* Researchers who create new data products (e.g., cleaned or gap-filled data sets, extracts from gridded databases) are encouraged to deposit those here.

For instrunctions on contributing to this repository, please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
